<h3>Tutorial: Creating a MasterPage with PHP</a></h3>
            <p>
                The concept of "master pages" allows for template-based web page development.
Master templates have <i>place-holder variables</i>, to denote where the dynamic content goes, as well as CSS, HTML and JavaScript shared across child pages.    
</p><p>
Wesites normally have common design elements that do not change from page to page and only the content differs.
</p><p>
Child pages use those <i>place-holder variables</i>, which must be mapped to the <i>place-holder variables</i> of the master page that the content page is populating, much like a mail merge in a word processor.
</p><p>
The master page remains fully accessible to the content page. This means that the content page may still manipulate headers, change title, configure caching etc.</p>
